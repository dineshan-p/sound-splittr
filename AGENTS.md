AGENTS.md

An audio stem splitter application using Demucs for DJing. This project enables DJs to create custom versions of their songs with separated stems (vocals, drums, bass, melody) for live remixing and performance.

---

## Important: Learning This Together

Since you're new to stem splitters, our goal is to build and understand the tool together:

- **Explain code**: Agents will explain key code sections as we build them
- **Good comments**: All code should have clear, educational comments
- **Step-by-step**: We'll progress in phases so you learn as we build
- **No jargon without explanation**: Technical terms get explained when they appear

---

## Communication Style

### For the Architect

- Always explain technical decisions in simple terms
- When introducing a concept, use an analogy
- Check understanding between major milestones

### For Audio Engineer

- Never assume knowledge of audio concepts
- Always comment WHY we do something, not just HOW
- Use audio metaphors ("

### For Documentation

- Start with "What this is" before "How it works"
- Always include "Why this matters"
- Keep examples beginner-friendly

---

## Code Commentary Standards

All code must follow these principles:

### DO: Include comments

```python
# Extract stems from multi-track audio audio_file
# Returns a dictionary with tracks separated into different stems
with open(audio_file) as f:
    # Process audio

def process_audio(audio):
    """Main function to process audio.
    Uses Demucs model to separate vocals, drums, bass, melody."""
    # ... implementation with comments
```

### FORGIVE: Occasional questions

- It's OK to ask for code explanations
- It's OK to say "I don't understand this part"
- Agents should explain any confusing section

### AVOID: Bare functions without docstrings

```
# BAD

def load_audio(file):
    return torchaudio.load(file)

# GOOD
def load_audio(file):
    """Load audio file into torch tensor format.

    Args:
        file: Path to audio file

    Returns:
        Tensor with audio data
		"""
    # Load the audio
    return torchaudio.load(file)
```

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal**: Basic splitter that works end-to-end

1. **Setup** (Architect leads)
   - Initialize Python project
   - Install dependencies
   - Create basic directory structure
   - Explain each file's purpose

2. **Audio Core** (Audio Engineer + Backend + Architect)
   - Integrate Demucs
   - Basic file input/output
   - Simple processing pipeline
   - Comment every audio operation

3. **Minimal UI** (Frontend + Backend)
   - Basic Streamlit or CLI interface
   - File upload
   - Download stem results
   - Simple "status" display

**End Goal**: Upload song → Get stems in 5 minutes → Download all stems

### Phase 2: Quality & Testing (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal**: Reliable, high-quality output

1. **Test Suite** (QA + Audio Engineer)
   - Create diverse test files (rock, pop, electronic, jazz)
   - Measure quality metrics
   - Test with different file sizes/formats
   - Document expected quality per genre

2. **Optimization** (Audio Engineer + Backend)
   - Batch processing improvements
   - Memory management
   - GPU vs CPU handling
   - Caching strategies

**End Goal**: Process any audio file reliably with good quality

### Phase 3: Polish & Documentation (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal**: Production-ready, easy to use

1. **User Guides** (Docs + Frontend)
   - "First Time Use" guide
   - "Understanding Your Stems" tutorial
   - "Best Practices" guide
   - FAQ and troubleshooting

2. **Code Polish** (Architect + All)
   - Final code review
   - Add missing comments
   - Fix bugs from testing
   - Performance improvements

3. **Deployment** (Deploy + Architect)
   - Docker images
   - Cloud deployment options
   - Local installation instructions

### Phase 4: Maintenance & Enhancement (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Keep improving

- Monitor usage and collect feedback
- Add new features as needed
- Update for new Demucs versions
- Expand genre coverage

## Technical Stack (Beginner-friendly)

### Core Dependencies

- **Python 3.10+**: Easy to learn, lots of resources
- **demucs**: Audio separation (handles the hard work)
- **librosa/torchaudio**: Audio processing tools
- **streamlit**: Web UI (simple Python-based)

### Why These?

- Python is great for beginners - lots of tutorials
- Demucs handles the complex audio AI stuff
- Streamlit means UI = just Python (no separate HTML/CSS)

### Optional Advanced Stack

- **FastAPI**: For REST API endpoints
- **React**: If we want custom UI later
- **Docker**: For consistent environments

1. **Start Simple**: First version should just work, not be perfect
2. **Test Often**: Catch issues early, learn from mistakes
3. **Learn Together**: This is about learning as we build
4. **Quality Over Speed**: Audio quality matters for DJing

---

## Next Steps

Before we begin:

1. Review this AGENTS.md and project plan
2. Discuss what features you care about most
3. Decide: web UI (Streamlit) or CLI?
4. Set up development environment together
